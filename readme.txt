Thank you for using our aqpearl plug-in. 
This is an instruction sheet to guide you through the
 process of how to properly use our plug-in. 
After successful installation of the plug-in, 
you will now be able to experience the live widget, 
custom post type and short code. A widget is a way to add 
content and features to your theme’s sidebars. They were originally 
designed to give an easy design and structure control to the WordPress theme 
user. In your WordPress Dashboard, you will see widgets under 
appearance where you can add the default widgets known as 
Categories, Search, Calendar etc. A custom post type is similar to a
 regular post except it’s “post_type” value in the database is different. 
Currently, the post type of posts is “post” and pages is “pages”, with a
 custom post type we can create new values. The custom post type 
will show up on the Dashboard as a separate menu item with the option 
to add pages and posts. A shortcode is similar to a shortcut, in which it is a WordPress-specific code that
 allows you to do a lot of things in a little bit 
of effort. It can embed files or create objects that would normally require a lot of 
complicated codes in only one line. There are two types of shortcodes 
and our plug-in uses a self-closing one. 


For this plug-in, a new widget which displays a 
custom post type is created into your WordPress.
 The widget can be activated through dragging on
 aqpearl into your sidebar. The custom post type created is for 
products, so all of your posts about your products will be 
displayed there on the homepage. The posts will be displayed 
in small thumbnails (small image representation of a larger image) 
with two columns and four rows in your sidebar. The shortcode 
created when used will display a small selection of posts of the
 products (custom post type), when called on. This shortcode 
can be used on any post with the option to enter content 
into a textfield. All you need to do is type “[custom_post_type]” 
into your posts and it will display a selection of the posts. 
We also have a shortcode that creates a button, all you 
need to do is type “[shortcode_button_link]” into your post 
and it will create a button with a clickable link.
